Hi All,  in this lab you will code the following problem
problem statement : Given a matrix whose rows and columns are sorted.
Design and implement an efficient algorithm for searching a given element. 
Take a small matrix say 4x4 which satifies the above condition to prove the correctness of your algorithm.
